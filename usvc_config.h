	#define USE_SECTION TOP_FIXED_SECTION
	Also set the section limit, i.e. the row at which the section starts (for bottom) or ends (for top). The number is in terms of tiles and it is not inclusive.

/* AUDIO.
	Audio is made of two modules. The sound Engine, and the Audio Mixer.
	The sound Engine is a port of Alec Borque's UZEBox sound engine, with minor changes, and it provides support for samples and songs.
	The audio mixer actually mixes the four channels producing one single mono 10 bit signal.
	To actually produce any audio output you must:
	1) define AUDIO_ENABLED as 1
	2) define USE_MIXER as 1
	3) Create one file, which defines an array of soundWave_t, containing the parmeters of all the sound waves you are using (including the default waves, if enabled!).
	   In other words: sondWave_t soundWaves[];
	   That file must also define the function "int getNumberOfSoundWaves()", which returns how many sound waves you have defined (i.e. it must return
	   sizeof (soundWaves) / sizeof(soundWave_t);
	4) Create some sound patches, and define a function "int getNumberOfPatches()", which returns the number of patches defined by you. In other words:
		int getNumberOfPatches() {return sizeof(patches) / sizeof(patch_t);}
	5) Include at the bottom of this file, the headers of the soundWaves and patches.
